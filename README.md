# Intermittent Empty FlatList Rendering in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native intermittently renders an empty list even when data is successfully fetched from an API. The issue is difficult to reproduce consistently, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

A FlatList component is used to display data fetched from an API.  Sometimes, the FlatList renders correctly, displaying the fetched data.  Other times, it renders as an empty list, even though the data is available and the API call is successful.  There are no apparent error messages or exceptions in the console.

## Reproduction Steps

The exact steps to reproduce the bug are inconsistent.  However, the problem seems more likely to occur after the app has been running for a while or under certain device conditions.

## Solution

A potential solution may involve using a more robust data loading mechanism or carefully handling state updates to ensure the FlatList always receives the correct data.  Consult the provided `bugSolution.js` for a possible resolution.
